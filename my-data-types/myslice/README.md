### Slices

A very often used data type that is often taken for granted.
This will probably be a very basic implementation without the magic `make()` function

#### Imtplementation
I'd like to use simple arrays for memory allocation. And would like to implement my own `size/length` and `capacity` functions. Making it generic is so basic of a task it's almost boring to type out.

I have to give the array an initial value else it is a slice

#### Goals
