# Learning Go

I threw together some servers in Go and I have really been liking it but my solutions felt dirty at times so I made this repo to write nice code in Go and while doing that understand the language more.

Each folder is it's own project, this is just a project. Will later restructure to make it more professional, more well structured.

### things I'd like to do:
- [x] linked list
- [ ] hashmap
- [ ] neural network
